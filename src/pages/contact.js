          <h2>actor. writer. yogi. cat video enthusiast.</h2>
          <p>Hey there and welcome to my website!</p>
          <p>I’m an actor local to Atlanta auditioning all over the Southeast, but I made my journey to the fantastic HOT-Lanta after a 5-year stint in Los Angeles where I received a Theater Arts degree from The American Academy of Dramatic Arts and studied at UCB, iO West, The Ivanna Chubbuck Studio, and various other schools around town.</p>
          <p>If you’d like to see what I do, I perform regularly on a House Team at Highwire Comedy, Co. here in Atlanta as well as on other teams like The Actor’s Worst Nightmare!</p>
          <p>Along with acting, I get together with a group of super savvy girls to collaborate on writing projects like sketches and screenplays each week.</p>
          <p>I also am an avid yogi that loves rock climbing and, as stated above…cat videos. Seriously. If you need a good laugh, I can hook you up.</p>
          <p>So peruse my site, feel free to get in contact with me if you have any questions, and have an awesome day!</p>
